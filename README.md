# Post Hit Counter

A counter to track how many times your posts are viewed.

"Post Hit Counter" does what it says on the tin - it counts how many hits your posts receive. Hit counts are displayed in a new column in the post list table, in the submit box on the post edit screen and in the admin bar on the frontend.

**Plugin Features**

- Easily visible hit counts in the dashboard and in the admin bar on the frontend
- Shortcode to display view count for current or specified post
- Widget to display your most viewed posts anywhere on your site
- Dashboard widget to show your most viewed posts at a glance
- No complicated analytics and statistics to wade through
- Option to select which post types must be counted
- Option to select which user roles should not trigger the hit counter

This is not meant as a replacement for more advanced analytics plugins - it is a counter so you can see which of your posts are more popular without diving too deeply into complicated viewing statistics.

*This plugin initially was created as a demo for [a workshop](http://2014.capetown.wordcamp.org/session/building-your-first-wordpress-plugin/) I ran at WordCamp Cape Town 2014. I have since fleshed it out and enhanced it to be more useful.*
