A counter to track how many times your posts are viewed.

== Description ==

"Post View Counter" does what it says on the tin - it counts your post views. View counts are displayed in a new column in the post list table in the dashboard as well as on the post edit screen. Currently this plugin only counts the views for the built-in `post` post type.

*This plugin was created for [a workshop](http://2014.capetown.wordcamp.org/session/building-your-first-wordpress-plugin/) I ran at WordCamp Cape Town 2014 and as such it is meant to act more as a demo then a full-featured plugin. I will flesh it out more over time, but please bear that in mind when using it.*
