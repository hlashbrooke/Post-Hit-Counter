A counter to track how many times your posts are viewed.

== Description ==

"Post Hit Counter" does what it says on the tin - it counts how many hits your posts receive. Hit counts are displayed in a new column in the post list table in the dashboard as well as in the submit box on the post edit screen. By default, this plugin counts hits for *all* post types, including pages, but you can select the post types for which you would like to track hits.

This is not meant as a replacement for more advanced analytics plugins - it is merely a simple counter so you can see which of your posts are more popular without diving too deeply into complicated viewing statistics.

*This plugin was created for [a workshop](http://2014.capetown.wordcamp.org/session/building-your-first-wordpress-plugin/) I ran at WordCamp Cape Town 2014 and as such it is meant to act more as a demo then a full-featured plugin. I will flesh it out more over time, but please bear that in mind when using it.*
