A counter to track how many times your posts are viewed.

== Description ==

"Post Hit Counter" does what it says on the tin - it counts how many hits your posts receive. Hit counts are displayed in a new column in the post list table, in the submit box on the post edit screen and in the admin bar on the frontend. By default, this plugin counts hits for *all* post types, including pages, but you can select the post types for which you would like to track hits.

**Plugin Features**

- Option to select which post types must be counted
- Option to select which user roles should not activate the hit counter
- Easy visible hit counts in the dashboard and in the admin bar on the frontend
- No complicated analytics and statistics to wade through

This is not meant as a replacement for more advanced analytics plugins - it is a counter so you can see which of your posts are more popular without diving too deeply into complicated viewing statistics.

*This plugin was created as a demo for [a workshop](http://2014.capetown.wordcamp.org/session/building-your-first-wordpress-plugin/) I ran at WordCamp Cape Town 2014. I have since fleshed it out and enhanced it to be more useful.*
